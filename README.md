**turtle da Vinci** is a project that uses the Google Quick Draw dataset to train a model that can generate doodles from text. The model uses pretrained Magenta models from the Google Brain [Magenta project](https://github.com/magenta/magenta). The project is built using React, Vite and Express.

The name **turtle da Vinci** is inspired by turtle graphics and the famous artist Leonardo da Vinci.

<sub>The project was built as part of the **Computer Engineering** bachelor's program at the University of Mumbai.</sub>
